# RideOn

RideOn is a TypeScript-first project. This README is a ready-to-use, easy-to-edit template designed to be dropped into the repository and customized with project-specific details (features, architecture, env vars, screenshots, etc.).

> NOTE: I don't have full context about the app's exact stack (frontend framework, backend, database). Replace the placeholder sections below with concrete details from the codebase (for example: React, Next.js, Express, NestJS, Node, Postgres, etc.).

## About

Short summary (1–2 lines) describing what RideOn does. Example:

RideOn is a TypeScript-based application for connecting riders and drivers, providing booking, realtime updates, and trip management. Replace this paragraph with a quick summary of RideOn's purpose and high-level goals.

## Features

- User authentication (signup/login) — replace if different
- Search for rides and drivers
- Request and accept rides
- Real-time trip status updates (WebSockets / real-time)
- Payment integration (placeholder)
- Admin dashboard (placeholder)

Replace the list above with the actual features implemented in the repository.

## Tech stack

Primary languages:
- TypeScript (primary)
- CSS
- JavaScript

Common technologies to mention (edit to match repo):
- Frameworks: React / Next.js / Vue / Svelte / Angular / Node.js
- Backend: Express / NestJS / Fastify
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- Realtime: Socket.IO / WebSockets / Firebase
- Testing: Jest / Vitest / Testing Library
- Bundler: Vite / Webpack
- Linting: ESLint, Prettier

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16 (or the version used by the project)
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose if repository includes containers

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SupunLiyanage88/RideOn.git
cd RideOn
```

Install dependencies (choose one):

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a .env file from the example (if present):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example environment variables (customize for your app):

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# API / Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/rideon

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Realtime
SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Update these to match the project's requirements.

### Development

Run the development server (example):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port your app uses).

### Production build

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start (after build):

```bash
npm start
```

If the project is a monorepo or contains separate frontend/backend, run the relevant commands in each package.

## Project structure

Below is an example structure — update to reflect the repository:

```
/
├─ src/
│  ├─ client/            # frontend (React/Next)
│  ├─ server/            # backend (Express/Nest)
│  ├─ shared/            # shared types/utilities
│  └─ index.ts
├─ scripts/
├─ tests/
├─ .env.example
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json
```

## Scripts

Common scripts (make sure these match package.json):

- npm run dev — start development server
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run start — start production server
- npm run test — run tests
- npm run lint — run linter
- npm run format — format code

## Testing

If tests exist, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

Describe unit, integration, and end-to-end test setups and how to run them. If using Docker or test databases, include instructions.

## Linting & formatting

Run lint and format checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Add a pre-commit hook with Husky (if the repo uses it) to enforce style.

## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A suggested CONTRIBUTING.md should include:

- How to open issues and PRs
- Branching strategy
- Commit message conventions (Conventional Commits)
- How to run tests locally
- Coding standards

Basic workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a descriptive branch: git checkout -b feat/awesome-feature
3. Make changes, run tests and linters
4. Open a pull request with a clear summary of changes

If you'd like, I can:
- Inspect the repository and tailor this README to the exact stack, scripts, and environment variables found in code.
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example, and a short usage guide with screenshots or examples based on the repository contents.

Tell me if you want me to fetch files from the repo and generate a fully specific README (I can update this file in the repo if you want).
