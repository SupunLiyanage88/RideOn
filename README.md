# RideOn

Ride Smart, Ride Safe. RideOn.

RideOn is a smart mobility app designed to enhance safety and convenience for riders. It helps users navigate efficiently while providing real-time tracking and security alerts. If a rider deviates from their intended path or faces potential danger, the admin can instantly view their route and status — ensuring maximum safety and accountability.

## Key Features

🚗 Smart Navigation: Real-time route tracking with accurate directions.

🛡️ Safety Alerts: Admin gets notified if a user goes off-route or faces a risk.

📍 Live Location Tracking: Monitor rides and locations seamlessly.

👤 Admin Dashboard: Centralized control to manage users and trips.

📊 Ride History: Keep track of past rides and performance insights.

## Novelty

RideOn introduces a unique safety mechanism — if the user takes a wrong path or deviates from their route, the admin is immediately notified with live location updates, enhancing both security and transparency.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Hosting: Render / Vercel (adjust if needed)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16 (or the version used by the project)
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose if repository includes containers

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SupunLiyanage88/RideOn.git
cd RideOn
```

Install dependencies (choose one):

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a .env file from the example (if present):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example environment variables (customize for your app):

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# API / Database
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/rideon

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Realtime
SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Update these to match the project's requirements.

### Development

Run the development server (example):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port your app uses).

### Production build

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start (after build):

```bash
npm start
```

If the project is a monorepo or contains separate frontend/backend, run the relevant commands in each package.

## Project structure

Below is an example structure — update to reflect the repository:

```
/
├─ src/
│  ├─ client/            # frontend (React/Next)
│  ├─ server/            # backend (Express/Nest)
│  ├─ shared/            # shared types/utilities
│  └─ index.ts
├─ scripts/
├─ tests/
├─ .env.example
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json
```

## Scripts

Common scripts (make sure these match package.json):

- npm run dev — start development server
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run start — start production server
- npm run test — run tests
- npm run lint — run linter
- npm run format — format code

## Testing

If tests exist, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

Describe unit, integration, and end-to-end test setups and how to run them. If using Docker or test databases, include instructions.

## Linting & formatting

Run lint and format checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Add a pre-commit hook with Husky (if the repo uses it) to enforce style.

If you'd like, I can:
- Inspect the repository and tailor this README to the exact stack, scripts, and environment variables found in code.
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md, .env.example, and a short usage guide with screenshots or examples based on the repository contents.

Tell me if you want me to fetch files from the repo and generate a fully specific README (I can update this file in the repo if you want).
